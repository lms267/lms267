This soundscape is meant to go through the process of how a latte is made for those who are either unfamiliar or curious about the process. I have worked as a 
barista for three years now, and every day people prove time and time again that they truly donâ€™t know what goes in their coffee. I am here to educate and help 
people understand what they are ordering. I am also very well-versed in the mechanics of different hardware used in the process, so I try to touch on that a bit as 
well for those who are unaware. Without getting too much into the specifics, I hope that after people listen to my soundscape, they have a bit more knowledge that 
they can use in their day-to-day life. Whether you are someone who loves espresso, someone who is looking to become a barista, or someone who wants to perfect their 
at-home morning coffee, I hope that this soundscape is of use to you, or is even just an entertaining listen.
