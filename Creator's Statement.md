When I first started this project, I had a few goals in mind; I wanted it to be educational, soothing, more on the formal side, and most importantly, 
to have fun with it. I have very minimal experience with audio editing in general, so I wanted to use this as an opportunity to just practice with audio editing. 
I didn’t have insanely high expectations for myself, I just wanted to create something that I was proud of, that I could call my own, and reflected the things that I love, 
which is my job. As I stated in my initial reflection, the biggest challenge I faced was auditory and recording challenges. The actual logistics of navigating Audacity weren’t 
too difficult, although I did play it a bit safer on that side of things. Obviously, working in a busy and loud café, it was tough trying to find quiet moments to record. I had 
to retake each clip several times before finally getting one without too much interference. I would say the second biggest challenge I faced was on the technological side, 
specifically involving GitHub. There were several documents that could not be uploaded, whether that be because of the file size or just a general GitHub error. To be quite honest, 
I still haven’t really worked out those kinks just yet, but hopefully the final submission is at least concise and easy to navigate.
	That being said, I feel like my initial motivations and vision for the project didn’t really change as I went on with it. I knew what I wanted the project to be, and I stayed 
consistent with that. There were a few stylist components that weren’t entirely what I envisioned, but overall, I am happy with the outcome. I am very excited to see what it can 
become by the end of the semester as I grow more comfortable with Audacity and editing tools.
